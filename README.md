# Hallo! I'm **Trey Morris**ðŸ‘‹
### Computer Science Student, IT, Website Freelancing

I'm a 19 year old Computer Science Student in my freshman year at Kennesaw State University. I've been around computers my whole life and from a young age I was exposed to basic fundementals of programming. From writing simple HTML websites for me and my friends, to now writing programs in different modern programming languages like Java and C#, I have always wanted to continue my understanding in the world of computing. I currently am working in IT for my school and currently working on expanding my portfolio with Website Freelancing.
