# Hallo! I'm **Trey Morris**üëã
### üñ•Ô∏è Computer Science Student

I'm a 21 year old Computer Science Student at Kennesaw State University. I've been around computers my whole life and from a young age I was exposed to basic fundementals of programming. From writing simple HTML websites for me and my friends, to now writing programs in different modern programming languages like Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript. I have always wanted to continue my understanding in the world of computing. I currently am working in IT for my school and working on expanding my portfolio with different personal coding projects.

<br />
<li>Object Oriented Programming: I've built various projects using different modern languages like Java, C#, and Python. </li>
<li>Web Development: With web development, I have worked with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a website for currency conversion using a public currency rate API. I am also familiar with Blazor Server of the .NET framework where I was part of a team project for a class. As part of the project, my job included things like building and using and API and databases using CosmosDB and Azure to provide information for our project.</li>
<li>Databases: I have worked with both relational and non-relational databases. I have worked with Microsoft SQL server and CosmosDB/MongoDB for various different projects.</li>
<li>Practical Concepts: I have studied and am familiar with various different practical Software Engineering concepts such as agile methodologies, writing unit tests, and writing clean and detailed documentation. I have also been using GitHub for years to host my personal projects, and have actively used source control for these projects.</li>
<li>Team Oriented Developer: I have worked together with other developers and students on projects to understand what it is like to be apart of a team. Being part of a team has taught me different things, such as making sure I give 100% to the project to be able to succeed as a group, and I have also learned leadership while being a leader on a project for a class.</li>

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Other Computer Stuff I enjoy</h3></summary>
 <ul>
   <li>Linux Ricingüçö: I am currently learning about Linux, with my current linux distro being Debian 12. I have taken an enjoyment to learning about customizing my UI experience and my machine. More about linux "ricing" <a href = "https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html">here</a>.</li>
   <li>NeoVim/VimüïπÔ∏è: HELP!!! HOW DO I EXIT????</li>
   <li>PC Buildingü™õ: I have always enjoyed watching Linus Tech Tips and other PC builders on YouTube. I built my first computer shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when computer part prices went through the roof. Great timing.</li>
   <li>Front-End Frameworksüîó: I enjoy making websites, and have enjoyed working with the backend side of web development. I've enjoyed working with APIs and databases. The next thing I really want to learn with web-development is a front-end framework like React or Angular. I hope to learn a front-end framework to enjoy the full-stack aspect of being a web developer and add more tools to my toolbelt.</li>
   <li>Rustü¶Ä: I've heard a lot about the Rust programming language. I plan on trying to do some small CLI side projects with Rust to learn about the language and see if I really enjoy it. Any projects with Rust will be posted on my GitHub.</li>
