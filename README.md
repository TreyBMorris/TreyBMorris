### Hallo! ðŸ‘‹
**Trey Morris**

I'm a 19 year old in my freshman year at Kennesaw State University. I've been around Computers my whole life and from a young age I was exposed to basic fundementals of programming. From writing simple HTML websites for me and my friends, to now writing programs in different modern programming languages like Java and C#, I have always wanted to continue my understanding of the worlds of Computuing. 

Current Skill Set:
- Intermediate Knowledge of HTML (Backed by the HTML LinkedIn Badge)
- Fundemental Knowledge of Modern Programming Languages such as Java, C#, and some Python.
- Basic Understanding of Source Control with Github
